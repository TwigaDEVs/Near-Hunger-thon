# Near-Hunger-thon

# Hambre (It is a spanish word that means *hunger*)

# About; 

The system will have 3 features which include:
      -It will aim to maximize the Productivity of arable lands.
      -Provide market places/oppotunities between the buyer(consumer) and seller(farmer).
      -Education to the farmers where they will provided with the best recommendations on the best way to achieve those requirements.

This project aims to increase food production by implementing improved agricultural practices and by helping farmers source income and farm equipment. This will be achieved through the use of the Near Protocol and blockchain technology, which will improve supply chain transparency and efficiency. The project will also help individuals with idle arable farms rent out their land, providing a new source of income and allowing them to contribute to food production. Additionally, the project will offer opportunities for individuals without access to farming land to hire or partner with farmers, allowing them to participate in food production and contribute to the local economy.

# Installations;

rust language "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html":
 
             -- $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

npm:
 
    -- 'npm install'
    -- npm -v

# Moving into the system

Clone the repo, then:

             -- cd Near-Hunger-thon      
             -- cd moshi

Run the commands:
=================

Build and deploy your contract to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy

Test your contract:

    npm test

In the moshi/frontend directory for it to run on the server:

             -- npm start 
             or
             -- npm run start
             or 
             -- yarn start


N/B; incase of any errors during run time;

             -- cd frontend 
             *check if the 'node_modules' are installed.

             *If the 'node_modules' directory exist, run these commands:
             -- rm -r node_modules
             -- npm install

# Code exploration

1. The smart-contract code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info. In blockchain apps the smart contract is the "backend" of your app.

2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/frontend/index.js`,
   this is your entrypoint to learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.

3. Test your contract: `npm test`, this will run the tests in `integration-tests` directory.

# App startUp

The server will startup on http://localhost:1234
